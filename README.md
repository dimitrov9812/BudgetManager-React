<h1>What it does?</h1>
This is an application for managing your budget. You can keep track of what you spent. Information about each cost can be entered.The information about each expense is:<br>
* The name of it.<br>
* The amount.<br>
* The date.<br>
* Note (whis is not required).<br>

The form has some simple validation. Currently to add and expense you must enter the name of it and the amount. Without one of the two required fileds you get an error message. If you manage to succesfully ad an expense you are redirected to the home page where you can review all of your expenses. Also on page refresh the expenses do show up again because they are being stored in a heroku database connected to your Google account.<br>
* Soon support for signing up with a different from Google account will be added.<br>
